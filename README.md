# Movie Search
## For movie lovers

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Start here:

This is a bare bones React project utilizing The Movie Database API to make up a sweet, sweet movie search web application.

Users can search for Movies or TV shows from the [The MovieDB](themoviedb.org) via an async search bar. Titles are displayed an can be clicked on for move information, such as a backdrop picture, full title and release date (or first air date in the case of TV shows)
